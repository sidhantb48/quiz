1.  Make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed on your computer. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website ([https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)).
    
2.  Clone or download the React project repository from https://github.com/sidhantb48/quiz
    
3.  Open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the project directory.
    
4.  Run the command `npm install` to install all the required dependencies for the project. This will create a `node_modules` folder in the project directory.
    
5.  After the dependencies are installed, run the command `npm start` to start the development server. This will compile the project and start the server on the default port 3000.
    
6.  Open a web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app running on your local machine.
    
7.  You can now make changes to the project code and the server will automatically reload the app to reflect the changes.
    

That's it! You should now be able to run a React app locally on your machine.
